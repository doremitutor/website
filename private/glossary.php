                <dd>The two by four measure is a measure of two beats, a quarter note corresponding to each as its time unit. The first of them is strong, which is indicated by a high-pitch metronome tick, and the second weak, indicated by a lower-pich one. Manually. its marking is realized as indicated in the figure to the right: first beat downwards and second upwards.</dd>

                <dd>In any scale, the function of the first degree or tonic is to serve as a tonal reference for the others, so it is attributed full stability, being the pitch toward which they need to resolve to satisfy the hearing.<br>This lesson presents exclusively the note Do (C) as the tonic of the scale of Do (C). Lacking any tension, this function induces a sensation of stillnes, safeness, restness, satisfaction, and even monotony. Nevertheless, the tediousness from the exercise proves more than compensated with the opportunity to get consciously acquainted with the stability from the tonic, besides being the starting point to develop the skill of recognition the remaining degrees.</dd>
